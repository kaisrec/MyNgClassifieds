# ngClassifieds - Source Code for Getting Started with Angular 1.x
This is the source code for my course 
**[Getting Started with Angular 1.x](https://school.scotch.io/getting-started-with-angularjs-1x)** 
available at [Scotch School](https://school.scotch.io).
To run the app, first install the dependencies with npm.
```bash
npm install
```
Then serve the app with whichever web server you like. You can use **http-server** for a quick solution.
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
